### Requirements:

To make use of scripts (especially for Excalidraw), you need to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and the Excalidraw plugin first. Excalidraw is a community plugin that can be installed in the settings:<br/>

Settings > Community plugins > Browse > type Excalidraw > click on Excalidraw > Install > Enable<br/>

If you have already installed and enabled Excalidraw but it doesn't appear in Obsidian, make sure you select the correct vault:<br/>
