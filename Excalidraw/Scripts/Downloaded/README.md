# AutoRenameDrawing.md

### What this script does:

After importing a PDF in a new drawing, the script automatically changes the name of the drawing to the name of the PDF.
Neither does it matter how the new drawing is being created, nor how the PDF (as image) gets imported in the new drawing.

However, the name of the drawing will not change, if a PDF has already been imported.
